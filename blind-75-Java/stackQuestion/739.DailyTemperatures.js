/*
739. Daily Temperatures
Given an array of integers temperatures 
represents the daily temperatures, return an array
 answer such that answer[i] is the number of 
 days you have to wait after the ith day to get
  a warmer temperature. If there is 
no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

Example 1:

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
Example 3:

Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]
 

Constraints:

1 <= temperatures.length <= 105
30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100

/*
Time Complexity
Each index is pushed and popped at most once from the stack, so the overall time complexity is 

O(n), where 

n is the length of the temperatures array.

Space Complexity
The result array uses 

O(n) additional space, and the stack also uses at most 

O(n) space in the worst case, so the total space complexity is 

O(n).
