2541. Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal II
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2
 of equal length n and an integer k. You 
 can perform the following operation on nums1:

Choose two indexes i and j and increment nums1[i]
 by k and decrement nums1[j] by k.
  In other words, nums1[i] = nums1[i] + k and nums1[j] = nums1[j] - k.
nums1 is said to be equal to nums2 
if for all indices i such that 0 <= i < n, nums1[i] == nums2[i].

Return the minimum number of operations 
required to make nums1 equal to nums2. If it is impossible to make them equal, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,3,1,4], nums2 = [1,3,7,1], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: In 2 operations, we can transform nums1 to nums2.
1st operation: i = 2, j = 0. After applying the operation, nums1 = [1,3,4,4].
2nd operation: i = 2, j = 3. After applying the operation, nums1 = [1,3,7,1].
One can prove that it is impossible to make arrays equal in fewer operations.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [3,8,5,2], nums2 = [2,4,1,6], k = 1
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be proved that it is impossible to make the two arrays equal.

/*

Time Complexity
O(n), where n is the length of the input arrays.

.every() is O(n).

A single for loop traverses the arrays once.

All indexing and arithmetic operations inside the loop are O(1).

Space Complexity
O(1) (constant space).

All variables (posSum, negSum, etc.) use a fixed amount of memory.

No additional data structures grow with input size.

    // match total decrease (thus, impossible).

// not a multiple of k to perform valid steps â€” return -1.
