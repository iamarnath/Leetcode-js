1329. Sort the Matrix Diagonally

A matrix diagonal is a diagonal line of cells 
starting from some cell in either the topmost row or 
leftmost column and going in the bottom-right direction
 until reaching the matrix's end. For example, the 
 matrix diagonal starting from mat[2][0], where 
 mat is a 6 x 3 matrix, includes cells mat[2][0], mat[3][1], and mat[4][2].

Given an m x n matrix mat of integers, sort each
 matrix diagonal in ascending order and return the resulting matrix.

Example 1:


Input: mat = [[3,3,1,1],[2,2,1,2],[1,1,1,2]]
Output: [[1,1,1,1],[1,2,2,2],[1,2,3,3]]
Example 2:

Input: mat = [[11,25,66,1,69,7],[23,55,17,45,15,52],[75,31,36,44,58,8],[22,27,33,25,68,4],[84,28,14,11,5,50]]
Output: [[5,17,4,1,52,7],[11,11,25,45,8,69],[14,23,25,44,58,15],[22,27,31,36,50,66],[84,28,75,33,55,68]]
 

Constraints:

m == mat.length
n == mat[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
1 <= mat[i][j] <= 100

Time Complexity
Grouping elements by diagonal: 
O(mn) as each entry in the matrix is visited once.

Sorting diagonals: Each diagonal may have up to 
O(min(m,n)) elements, so sorting all diagonals takes 
O(Dâ‹…LlogL), where 
D is the number of diagonals and 
L is the length of the largest diagonal.

In total, sorting cost is dominated by 
O(mnlogL).

Filling elements back: 
O(mn) for placing sorted elements.

Overall Time Complexity:
O(mnlogL)
where 
L=min(m,n).

Space Complexity
Map storage: An extra array for every diagonal, total elements: 

O(mn).

Auxiliary storage for diagonals plus matrix itself: Also 
O(mn).

Total Space Complexity:

O(mn)
since diagonals collectively cover all matrix elements.

References
Map and sort approach: Efficient and concise way to sort matrix diagonals.

Complexity: Both time and space are efficient for large matrices, only linearithmic due to sort.

Step	Complexity	Description
Grouping diagonals	O(mn)	One pass through matrix
Sorting arrays	O(mn log L)	Each diagonal sorted
Filling matrix	O(mn)	One pass to fill sorted entries
Overall:

Time: 
O(mnlogL)

Space: 

O(mn)
